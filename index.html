      The Contest<br>
      The online judging software will run in contest mode and the problem set
      will become available. An online scoreboard of all the teams will be
      displayed in the first four hours, but will freeze in the last hour
      (teams will only be able to see the results of their own submissions, to
      create a little suspense before the results are announced).<br>
      Snacks and soft drinks will be provided.
