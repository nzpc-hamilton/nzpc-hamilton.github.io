      Practice Session<br>
      The online judging software will run in practice mode with some example
      problems. This is an opportunity to learn how the judging system works
      and check that you can successfully submit solutions to problems.

      The Contest<br>
      The online judging software will run in contest mode and the problem set
      will become available. An online scoreboard of all the teams will be
      displayed in the first four hours, but will freeze in the last hour
      (teams will only be able to see the results of their own submissions, to
      create a little suspense before the results are announced).

    <td>7pm - 8pm</td>
    <td>Normally we offer pizza at this time, but not this year :(<br>
      Teams are encouraged to uphold the tradition and acquire their own
      pizza.</td>
